## About

Welcome to the Numerical methods University Course Repository!
This repository contains completed labs for the Numerical Methods course at my university. The labs provide hands-on experience with various numerical techniques and methodologies used in computational mathematics.



## Labs Description
1. Matlab Tutorial
  - Folder: Lab_1
  - Status: Completed and Published
  - Description: This lab focuses on completing the Matlab tutorial to familiarize students with the basic functionalities of Matlab for numerical computations.
2. Sparse Matrices in Matlab and tasks executing 
  - Folder: Lab_2
  - Status: Completed and Published
  - Description: In this lab, students execute tasks in Matlab and become acquainted with sparse matrices. Sparse matrices are used to efficiently handle large datasets where the majority of elements are zero, optimizing memory usage and computational efficiency.
3. Direct and Iterative Methods for Solving Linear Systems
  - Folder: Lab_3
  - Status: Completed and Published
  - Description: This lab explores the basic features of direct and iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations. Direct methods, such as Gaussian elimination, solve the system by performing a sequence of mathematical operations. Iterative methods, such as the Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel method, iteratively improve an initial guess to converge towards the solution.
